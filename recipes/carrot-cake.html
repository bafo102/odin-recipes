    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This carrot cake is my favorite recipe, and I have tried many carrot cakes! If you don't like pecans, feel free to leave them out.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugars:</strong> You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong>All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaveners:</strong> Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Carrots:</strong> Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</li>
        <li><strong>Pecans:</strong> Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong> and <strong>cream cheese:</strong> Butter and cream cheese are the key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.</li>
    </ul>
        
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the batter:</strong> Beat the wet ingredients together, then mix in the dry ingredients.
            Stir in the carrots and fold in the pecans.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the cake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan or pans.
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Frost the cake:</strong> Beat the frosting ingredients together until smooth and creamy. Stir in the pecans.
            Frost the (completely cooled) cake.</li>
    </ol>
